                    The Atakor Plateau is situated in the Ahaggar National Park and is covered with sheer peaks and
                    mountains. The entire area is covered with sands and brown and dry landscape. There is not much

                    place is beautiful in its own majestic terms. The highest peak present there is the Assekrem Plateau
                    which means the ” End of the world” and it rightly justifies the meaning.

          Algeria is a North African country with a Mediterranean coastline and a Saharan desert interior. Many empires
          have left legacies here, such as the ancient Roman ruins in seaside Tipaza. In the capital, Algiers, Ottoman
          landmarks like circa-1612 Ketchaoua Mosque line the hillside Casbah quarter, with its narrow alleys and
          stairways. The city’s Neo-Byzantine basilica Notre Dame d’Afrique dates to French colonial rule.

            <p>
              Algeria’s ancient history can be traced as far back as 10,000 BC which is evident in discoveries
              throughout the country, particularly the cave and rock paintings of Tassili N’Ajjer National Park (Sahara
              Dessert). These paintings depict the way of life of the early Berbers who resided in the region thousands
              of years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Carthaginian Era marked the start of trade. Their poor treatment of the Berbers created antipathy
              amongst the locals. Berber soldiers eventually rebelled and destroyed the main city in the mid 2nd century
              BC. Berber rule was at its peak after that, but due to Roman influence, kingdoms were divided and fell
              under Roman leadership for the next 200 years. Evidences of this are found in the ancient city of Timgad
              (Aurés Mountains), where fascinating ruins still stand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The period between the 7th century and the 1500’s involved Arab conquests, which converted most of the
              locals to Islam, followed by the Spanish occupation. Fort Santa Cruz in Oran is one of the most iconic
              remnants of this period. The Turks relinquished control and made Algeria part of the Ottoman Empire in the
              1500’s. Reminders of this can still be found in many parts of the Old City (Casbah) in Algiers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The French rule lasted for more than a century and is described as one of the darkest times in Algerian
              history. Colonization led to the death of a large percentage of the country’s indigenous population.
              French settlers began to take over and reap agricultural riches from the lands. The War of Independence
              ultimately gave Algeria freedom, though there was still tension between the Arabs and the Berbers, and
              politics remained unstable. A civil war ensured, but eventually quieted down with the election of
              Abdelaziz Bouteflika as the President.
