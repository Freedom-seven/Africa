                    The Tsodilo Hills appear almost suddenly out of the ground in the northwest Kalahari. These imposing
                    rock formations of varying shapes and sizes are made to love even more impressive by the relative
                    flatness of the surrounding land in the Kalahari.

                    Although mainly used as a stop off for tourists on the way to Muan or Kasane, Gweta is worth
                    visiting for its namesake, the species of bullfrog that live in the area. The frogs hide themselves
                    in the sand until it rains and they can emerge from their sandy slumber. Other than these amazing
                    creatures, there is little to see in Gweta, although the fuel station here is handy for pass through
                    and will probably see you call in at some point during your time here.

                    This game reserve is the third largest in Botswana but it has one of the largest concentrations of
                    rare game animals in the continent of Africa. The national park takes its name from the Chobe River
                    which, at first glance is guaranteed to take your breathe away. As well as being a beautiful sight,
                    the river supports an ecosystem of rare and exotic creatures including birds, elephants, lions,
                    giraffes, baboons and buffalo. During the winter season it is possible to see a herd of hundreds of
                    elephants at a time; a truely once in a lifetime experience.

                    Kasane is situated between the Four Corners of Africa; where Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zamibia
                    meet. It is a great spot to stay for visits to the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe or Botswana’s own
                    Chobe National Park. The town’s own attractions include a huge Baobab tree that was once used as a
                    prison due to its trunk that is so large a human can enter. There is also a snake park that houses
                    around 50 snakes from 17 different species. The town is also wonderfully situated for exploring the
                    Chobe River.

                    Voted the best game reserve in the African continent in 2008, this park has a lot going for it. It
                    is the first reserve that was solely founded by local residents who were growing ever more
                    concerened about natural and man-made threats to the local enviroment and wildlife. Situated on the
                    east side of the Okavango Delta, the reserve offers some of the most stunning scenery in the country
                    and boasts an equally impressive ecosystem.

                    grasslands to swamps. Safaris and game watching are the most popular activities in the park and
