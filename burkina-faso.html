          <p class="about-countries">
            Burkina Faso, landlocked country in western Africa. The country occupies an extensive plateau, and its geography is characterized by a savanna that is grassy
             in the north and gradually gives way to sparse forests in the south.A former French colony, it gained independence as Upper Volta in 1960. The name Burkina Faso,
              which means “Land of Incorruptible People,” was adopted in 1984. The capital, Ouagadougou, is in the centre of the country and lies about 500 miles (800 km) from the Atlantic Ocean.
            Burkina Faso is bounded by Mali to the north and west, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, and Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo to the south.

          <p class="culture-content">
            The culture of Burkina Faso in West Africa is also called the Burkinabé culture.
            Two key elements of culture in Burkina Faso (a country once known as Upper Volta) are its indigenous masks and dancing.
             The masks used in this region of the western Sahel are made for rites of sacrifice to gods and animal spirits in the villages.
              Native dance, on the other hand, is employed to demonstrate the villagers' desire for blessings by the spirits.
            Burkina Faso translates to “land of the honest people” and about half its population comes from a long line of warriors
             who once reigned over the most influential empires in the region for more than eight centuries (11th to 19th).
              The country has gone through several name changes, from Haute Volta to Upper Volta, finally settling on Burkina Faso.
            Its landlocked position in the heart of West Africa explains the many nomadic tribes in the northern regions.
