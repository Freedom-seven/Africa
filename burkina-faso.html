                        and are to be admired, especially during the rainy season, during which you can enjoy an excellent view.

                      Not far from the waterfalls are the Fabedougou Domes, limestone mounds that have been carved by the elements over millenia.
                       It is a dramatic sight to see them stretch out over the horizon.
                       A great place for an early morning hike, or do it later in the day and plan for a cool-off at the waterfalls following your trek.

                      It has easier access than other towns of the region. The streets of this area are packed with colorfully dressed vendors, horses and camels.
                       This gives you the feel of a local market of Africa. Nearby is a cattle market where you will find people selling cattle, horses, donkeys and goats etc.

            Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. Although relatively small in area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa,
            partly because of its considerable natural wealth and partly because it was the first black African country south of the Sahara to achieve independence from colonial rule.
            In addition to being known for its lush forests, diverse animal life, and miles of sandy beaches along a picturesque coast, Ghana is also celebrated for its rich history.

            The six larger groups are the Akan (Ashanti and Fanti), the Ewe, the Ga-Adangbe, the Mole-Dagbani, the Guan and the Gruma.
            Like most other African nations, Ghana has rich, traditional cultures that differ from one ethnic group to another.<br>
            Along with different ethnic groups and cultures, 52 separate languages and hundreds of dialects are spoken in Ghana.
              The official language is English — a residual of British colonial rule, from which modern Ghana gained independence in 1957.
            The people of Ghana are warm and friendly. They are polite, open and trusting — even with strangers.
              In Ghanaian society, it is traditional to take life at a relaxed pace and view time as a series of events rather than a matter of hours or minutes.

            Kente (Akan: nwentoma; Ewe: kete) refers to a Ghanaian textile, made of handwoven cloth, strips of silk and cotton.
             Historically the fabric was worn in a toga-like fashion by royalty among ethnic groups such as the Ashanti and Ewe in modern day Ghana,
             the wearing of Kente cloth has become widespread to commemorate special occasions, with highly sought after Kente brands led by master weavers.<br>
            Due to the popularity of Kente cloth patterns, Kente print, which is a mass-produced version,
             is popular throughout the West. Globally, the print is used in the design of academic stoles in graduation ceremonies.

                 On 1 July 1960, Ghana became a commonwealth republic with Nkrumah as the first President of the country.
