                    Situated at the edge of an extinct volcano, the island was discovered in 1460 by the Portuguese,
                    when it was mostly uninhabited. Portuguese word ‘Sal’ derives its name from ‘salt’ which was found
                    in large quantities in Pedre De Lume and was also the primary trade long time ago in this island,
                    which has now become extinct as that of its volcano. Sal popularly attracts tourists for its white
                    sandy beaches.

                    The island situated in the east of Cape Verde, has the best contradictions to offer to those who
                    come to visit it. It’s a heady mix of sand dunes and pristine beaches. The Viana Desert of Boa
                    Vista, stretching from a few kilometres of white sand to one of the most beautiful beach, the Chaves
                    Beach, certainly does justice to this place. Boa Vista also boasts of brilliant music and culture.
                    Sal Rei, the largest habitat in the island, reminds the tourists of the city’s colonial past.

                    Praia is situated on the fertile island of Santiago and is the capital city of Cape Verde. The city,
                    like many capitals, is the economic and political home of Cape Verde. The town is not as focused on
                    tourism as many destinations in Cape Verde but it does have plenty to explore nonetheless. The old
                    colonial buildings in the city’s old town are great for exploring in the sunshine and make for some
                    pretty photo opportunities too. There are also churches, a presidential palace and the parliament
                    building to be seen. If all the exploring and culture gets too much then there are, of course,
                    beautiful sandy beaches nearby although it should be noted that the nearby Praia de Gamboa is not
                    recommended for swimming.

                    The town of Ribeira Grande, the erstwhile capital city of Cape Verde, has much to offer in terms of
                    history. Renamed Cidade Velha in the late 18th century it was the first European colonial set up. It
                    is located in the southern part of the island of Santiago. The town is listed in the World Cultural
                    Heritage by the UNESCO. For all the history enthusiasts, the town features two churches, a royal
                    fortress and Pillory Square with an ancient 16th century marble pillar.

                    With a more humid, temperate, and cooler climatic conditions, this town is ideal for colourful
                    vegetation, flowers, mountain terrains and landscape views. This quaint little town has no beaches
                    to adorn, yet the picturesque view of flowers and plantations make it an interesting and relaxed
                    getaway. The place is ideal for trekking and hiking around the little peaks of the island.

                    vegetation, landscapes. A tree that can live for a century, named the ‘dragon tree’ is certainly a
                    crowd puller. The capital city of Sao Nicolau, Ribeira Brava, the colourful capital city is apt for
                    a leisure walk, while witnessing colourful houses and colonial architecture.

                    Maio is also untapped in terms of tourism. Commercially unexploited, Maio houses Nostra Senora de
                    Luz, a Baroque church and perfect crystal clear sandy beaches of Morro. The island is ideal for some
                    exquisite bird watching and spotting turtles from the month of July to October.

        <p class="about-countries">
          Cape Verde or Cabo Verde, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an archipelago and island country in the
          central Atlantic Ocean, consisting of ten volcanic islands with a combined land area of about 4,033 square
          kilometres.Cabo Verde is named for the westernmost cape of Africa, Cape Verde (French: Cap Vert), which is
          located in nearby Senegal and is the nearest point on the continent. The largest port in the islands is
          located at Mindelo, on São Vicente. Its deepwater harbour accommodates sizable vessels and has been used as a
          fueling station since the 19th century.

          cotton that was grown, dyed dark indigo, and woven on narrow looms by slaves in Cabo Verde; the cloths were a
          valuable form of currency for the slave trade on the mainland.

              The uninhabited island of Santiago, founded in 1462 was colonised by the Portuguese, the first permanent
              settlement city in the tropics. Slaves were brought here from West Africa and by the 16th century Santiago
              was highly successful as the transatlantic slave trade flourished.
            </p>
            In 1675 the decline of the Cape Verde Islands became apparent when the Portuguese Crown agreed monopoly
            rights whereby slaves could be directly bought from the coast on New Guinea bypassing Cape Verde completely.
            In addition Cape Verde became increasingly vulnerable to attacks by rival countries as well as pirates. An
            attack in 1712 by the French led to the sacking of Santiago and robbed Ribeira Grande of its riches. The
            city declined in importance and in 1770 Praia became the capital.
            Cape Verde suffered the first of many droughts in 1742. Despite their requests Portugal refused to plough
            money into the Islands for nothing in return. With goats overgrazing on the already limited vegetation and
            the severe lack of funds it was inevitable that famine was going to strike. As a result thousands of people
            died as the droughts and starvation took hold. It is thought that 44% of the population at that time died.
            The once lush islands were now dry and barren. Many Cape Verdeans fled the Islands and emigrated to America
            in the hope of a better life.
