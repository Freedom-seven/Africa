                      Situated on the country’s western boundaries, Lake Chad used to be the world’s biggest freshwater lake in its prime time that was about 35 years before. It is of massive economic and historical significance as it supplies water to about 75 million people belonging to 4 separate countries that encompass it. Devastating climate changes and some lack of rains have diminished the lake to a fragment of its previous size and splendor. However, it lasts a beloved destination for fishing, boating, and other aquatic activities.

          <p class="about-countries">
            Chad, landlocked state in north-central Africa. The country’s terrain is that of a shallow basin that rises gradually from the Lake Chad area in the west and is rimmed by mountains to the north, east, and south. Natural irrigation is limited to the Chari and Logone rivers and their tributaries, which flow from the southeast into Lake Chad. The capital, N’Djamena (formerly Fort-Lamy), is almost 1,000 miles (1,600 km) by road from the western African coastal ports.
Although it is the fifth largest country on the continent, Chad—much of the northern part of which lies in the Sahara—has a population density of only about 20 persons per square mile (8 persons per square km). Most of the population lives by agriculture; cotton is grown in the south, and cattle are raised in the central region. Chad joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003, raising hopes that the revenues generated would improve the country’s economic situation.

            Chad is an ethnically diverse nation with a very interesting and colorful culture. The Colonial French rule has influenced their contemporary society, but about 200 ethnic groups still live in the country. Although there have been plenty of attempts to unify them, they continue to live and operate autonomously.
