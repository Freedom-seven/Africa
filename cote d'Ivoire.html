          <p class="about-countries">
            Côte d'Ivoire is a West African country with beach resorts, rainforests and a French-colonial legacy. Abidjan, on the Atlantic coast, is the country’s major urban center.
             Its modern landmarks include zigguratlike, concrete La Pyramide and St. Paul's Cathedral, a swooping structure tethered to a massive cross.
              North of the central business district, Banco National Park is a rainforest preserve with hiking trails.
            Ivory Coast's political capital is Yamoussoukro in the centre of the country, while its economic capital and largest city is the port city of Abidjan.
             It borders Guinea to the northwest, Liberia to the west, Mali to the northwest, Burkina Faso to the northeast, Ghana to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) to the south.
              The official language of the republic is French, with local indigenous languages also being widely used that include Baoulé, Dioula, Dan, Anyin, and Cebaara Senufo. In total, there are around 78 different languages spoken in Ivory Coast.

            The culture of the Ivory Coast is layered and colorful thanks to the nation's geographical location, collection of ethnic groups and years under French occupation.
             They have an excess of 60 different indigenous tribes and even more sub clusters, all with their own distinct identities and traditions.
            Music is also a big part of life in the Ivory Coast, and while each of the country’s ethnic groups has its own take on traditions, some rhythms and melodies are universal.
             Music is used in all kinds of celebrations, as well as in times of grief. Different instruments including the talking drum, kpalogo, djembe, shekere, cleavers,
            and akombe are used to express various emotions. These are handcrafted from indigenous materials like animal skins, gourds and horns.

                Côte d'Ivoire became a French protectorate in 1883, a colony in 1889, and a territory of French West Africa in 1904.
                 It gained full independence from France in 1960. For 33 years, between 1960 and 1993, Côte d'Ivoire was ruled by a single man:
                  president Félix Houphouet-Boigny, a benign dictator who led the country from independence to economic prosperity.
                   He chose to keep close cultural, political, and economic ties with France (the French still maintain a modest military presence),
                    and in 1985 changed the nation's official name from Ivory Coast to Côte d'Ivoire. Côte d'Ivoire is a member of the"Zone Franc,"
                    and its currency is backed by the French treasury. True democratic institutions were slow to arrive, but Houphouet-Boigny's
                     single-handed rule (no opposition parties were allowed until 1990) was not marred by the sort of terror and torture that
                      characterized many of the dictatorial governments that emerged from the former colonies of West Africa after 1960.
                       From the late 1950s through the start of the twenty-first century, Côte d'Ivoire enjoyed a prosperity and a political
                        stability unmatched in neighboring countries. When Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, president Bédié became the country's leader until he was ousted in a coup in 1999.
                 In October of 2000, Laurent Gbagbo was democratically elected to a five-year term as Côte d'Ivoire's president.
