                    The Bahariya Oasis came to the limelight in 1996 when a massive burial site with over thirty tombs
                    was discovered here. The site contained around 250 “Golden Mummies” dating back to different periods
                    of time throughout history. The site also holds the ruins and remnants of the Temple of Alexander.
                    Other than being found as a burial ground for mummies, Bahariya also acts as a major agricultural
                    center for Egypt, famous for its wine production even till date.

                    the most popular diving sites in the world. The park is tucked amidst the colorful coral reefs and
                    mangroves of the Red Sea as well as the inland desert of the Sinai. It has crystal-clear waters that
                    allow divers and snorkeling enthusiasts to easily spot the vibrant corals as well as vertebrate and
                    invertebrate marine species. If one is to take a boat to go a little further into the sea, they
                    might even be able to spot dolphins, including Risso’s Dolphin.

                    over thousands of years. The Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is 138 meters high
                    and is open to tourists via the Robber’s Tunnel. The limestone Sphinx structure is also part of the
                    same complex. The pyramids complex of Giza is the jewel of Egypt tourist attractions and one of the

                    kings such as Tutankhamun and Amenhotep were buried here. Although there are about 63 tombs that
                    have been excavated, only a small number is open to tourists.

                    The temple was relocated because of the rising waters of the lake in the 60s.

        <p class="about-countries">
          Egypt, country located in the northeastern corner of Africa. Egypt’s heartland, the Nile River valley and
          delta, was the home of one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East and, like Mesopotamia
          farther east, was the site of one of the world’s earliest urban and literate societies. Pharaonic Egypt
          thrived for some 3,000 years through a series of native dynasties that were interspersed with brief periods of
          foreign rule. After Alexander the Great conquered the region in 323 BCE, urban Egypt became an integral part
          of the Hellenistic world. Under the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, an advanced literate society thrived in the city
          of Alexandria, but what is now Egypt was conquered by the Romans in 30 BCE. It remained part of the Roman
          Republic and Empire and then part of Rome’s successor state, the Byzantine Empire, until its conquest by Arab
          Muslim armies in 639–642 CE.

              The history of Egypt has been long and wealthy, due to the flow of the Nile River with its fertile banks
              and delta, as well as the accomplishments of Egypt's native inhabitants and outside influence.
              Predominantly native Egyptian rule lasted until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth century
