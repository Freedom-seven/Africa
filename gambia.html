                       it was captured by the Dutch 150 years later and became the headquarters of their West Indies Company for the following 250 years.

                       As the name implies, the overhang on the top is large enough to cover 12 to 15 people at once.
                       Even though the pivot on which the top rock lies on might seem small, it's very strong.

                      Ghana is most famous for its coastline which is where the majority of tourists will spend their holidays, though the best beaches lay way out west,
                       too far for a weekend getaway from Accra. I was luckily able to find an exception to the rule in a relatively undiscovered piece of paradise in the East going towards
                       Togo – a gorgeous palm-lined and rustic beach near the fishing town of Ada Foah…and decided to give it a try one weekend. Best. Escape. Ever.

                       it has become popular among tourists and the pond is now reliant on tourism to ensure the population of crocodiles remain fed and healthy. It is also known as Chief's pond.

          <p class="about-countries">
            Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. Although relatively small in area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa,
            partly because of its considerable natural wealth and partly because it was the first black African country south of the Sahara to achieve independence from colonial rule.
            In addition to being known for its lush forests, diverse animal life, and miles of sandy beaches along a picturesque coast, Ghana is also celebrated for its rich history.

            The six larger groups are the Akan (Ashanti and Fanti), the Ewe, the Ga-Adangbe, the Mole-Dagbani, the Guan and the Gruma.
            Like most other African nations, Ghana has rich, traditional cultures that differ from one ethnic group to another.<br>
            Along with different ethnic groups and cultures, 52 separate languages and hundreds of dialects are spoken in Ghana.
              The official language is English — a residual of British colonial rule, from which modern Ghana gained independence in 1957.
            The people of Ghana are warm and friendly. They are polite, open and trusting — even with strangers.
              In Ghanaian society, it is traditional to take life at a relaxed pace and view time as a series of events rather than a matter of hours or minutes.

            Kente (Akan: nwentoma; Ewe: kete) refers to a Ghanaian textile, made of handwoven cloth, strips of silk and cotton.
             Historically the fabric was worn in a toga-like fashion by royalty among ethnic groups such as the Ashanti and Ewe in modern day Ghana,
             the wearing of Kente cloth has become widespread to commemorate special occasions, with highly sought after Kente brands led by master weavers.<br>
            Due to the popularity of Kente cloth patterns, Kente print, which is a mass-produced version,
             is popular throughout the West. Globally, the print is used in the design of academic stoles in graduation ceremonies.
