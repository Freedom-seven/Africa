                    Created in the early 20th century to protect a water collection point for nearby communities, Abuko
                    Nature Reserve is The Gambia’s first reserve – officially formed in the 1960’s.
                    This area is rich in Gambian wildlife and is now the most visited tourist attraction in the country
                    – with over 33,000 visitors each year.
                    Conservation efforts are on-going in this 260 acre reserve with three primate species here as well
                    as antelope, porcupine, African palm civets, crocodiles, galagos, and almost 300 bird species.

                    Bijilo Forest Park, or Monkey Park, is located in the coastal zone, just 11km from Banjul.
                    It’s a small reserve, relatively speaking, and is a point of pride for nearby locals.
                    The trails here are well maintained and take you through incredibly lush flora, a gallery forest,
                    grass and low bush, on your way to the dunes.
                    The three primate species are the red colobus, vervet, and patas.
                    Tourists are encouraged not to feed the monkeys as they can get pretty cheeky!
                    Bird lovers will love the more than 100 species found in the park including osprey, bee-eaters, and
                    francolin. The reviews seem to be consistent: a charming reserve that everyone falls in love with.

                    This is a sleepy beach village of about 7,000 people made up mostly of Wolof, Mandinka, Fula, and
                    Jola tribes. Sangyang Beach, which is made up of Paradise, Osprey, and Pelican beaches, is
                    considered by many to be the best beachfront in all of The Gambia.
                    It was a popular attraction long before the tourist trail made its way there and has a long stretch
                    of remote shore, surrounded by mangroves and lagoons.
                    Perfect for those who want to get away from the crowds. The main economy is fishing and as such
                    there is a fantastic fish market in the village.

                    Located in the Central River Region, these circles are believed to be the burial sites of ancient
                    kings and chiefs.
                    Dated to 750-1000 AD, the stones and layouts vary from 4-6 metres in diameter, with anywhere from
                    ten to 20 stones each.
                    Each stone has an average height of six feet and many tourists and archaeologists have puzzled over
                    their origins and true meaning.
                    Though the biggest concentration of stone circles is in the Wassu area, there are hundreds of
                    circles throughout the country.

                    Locals believe in the healing powers of the water and it’s a popular place to come for a blessing.
                    There are about 80 crocodiles that call the pool home and a cool dozen are usually immediately

                    In the 1990’s two Britons stepped in and began conservation efforts on this almost bare forest.

                    There’s a popular quote that helps to explain the relationship between the country and the river:
                    “The Gambia River is the Gambia and the Gambia is the river Gambia.”
                    The country exists as two strips of land on either side of the river and it’s definitely the
                    dominate feature of the country.
                    It’s become a popular tourist destination as it provides access to the interior as well as to
                    Senegal and Guinea.

                    The capital of The Gambia is Banjul. It’s a port city and is located on Saint Mary’s Island.
                    Originally called Bathurst after the Secretary of State for the British Colonies, Banjul is the
                    government seat for the country.
                    For whatever reason, many tourists don’t give Banjul a second glance. But with the busy harbour,
                    rich history, colonial architecture, and urban market, there is plenty to love about the city.
                    Enjoy the street hawkers from Senegal and Guinea and the shop keepers packed into old colonial
                    trading housing all creating a chaotic vibrancy to the commercial district.

          The Gambia is a small West African country, bounded by Senegal, with a narrow Atlantic coastline. It's known
          for its diverse ecosystems around the central Gambia River. Abundant wildlife in its Kiang West National Park
          and Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve includes monkeys, leopards, hippos, hyenas and rare birds. The capital, Banjul,

          The Guinean culture is very colorful, thanks to the people’s diverse ethnic backgrounds. The population is
          made up of different tribes with distinct languages, social structures and customs, but Guineans are generally
          very accepting of their differences. Some of the more prominent groups are Fula, Mandinka, Balanta, Papel,
          Manjaco, and Mancanha, who live in different regions. Much of the remainder of the population is a mix of
          African and Portuguese descent. There is also a Cape Verdean minority.
          Until the arrival of other civilizations, most of the local population adhered to animist beliefs. Today,
          however, the majority practice Islam, followed by Christianity and indigenous religions. Traditions are often
          practiced with a certain syncretism with conventional African beliefs and practices.

              The 5th to 11th-century empire of Ghana and the 13th- to 15th-century empire of Mali once made up the
              region currently known as Gambia. Towards the end of 1456, James Island welcomed the first navigators from
              Portugal, who immediately began trading along the coast of West Africa. From the 15th to 16th centuries,
              the Portuguese exchanged iron, firearms, salt, pots, gunpowder, and pans for gold, ebony, ivory, and
              beeswax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baltic Germans built their James Island fort in 1651, but the British displaced them in 1661. French
              ships, African kings and pirates constantly threatened the British, so newer forts were established at
              Bathurst (modern-day Banjul) and Barra, as well as on the mouth of the River Gamba. Fort James served as a
              slave post until the practice was abolished in 1807. Meanwhile, the British continued to move upstream and
              finally, in 1820, the entire region was declared a British Protectorate and classified a crown colony in
              1888.
            </p>
            <p>
              The desire for independence became stronger after WWI when some Gambians were recruited to join the Allies
              only to find out that they were still considered second-class citizens. Self-governance did not happen
              until 1963, and it took Gambia two more years to finally achieve complete independence. David Jawara, the
              People’s Progressive Party leader, was appointed the prime minister.

              Gambia is the last of the Britain’s colonies to gain full independence because of its size and poverty
              issues, but they have showed signs of progress. In 1981, a failed coup was conducted by the military
              leading to the 1982 Senegambia Confederation. This almost unified Senegal and Gambia, but the idea was
              terminated in 1989. Both countries still maintain good ties, making it easy to go on daytrips between
              Gambia and Senegal.

              There was another coup in 1994, and although there was no bloodshed, it halted the tourism industry.
              Luckily, this has since recovered in the 1996 elections when Yahya Jammeh won. In recent years, Gambia has
              been experiencing steady economic growth and still maintains close ties to the UK.
