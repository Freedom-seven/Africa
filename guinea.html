                    Mount Nimba is located at a height of 5,700 feet with
                    views of sea and the clouds from the mountains. The
                    mountains are situated at a very great height. It is not
                    possible to climb the mountain on your own and you are
                    required to take a guide with you who can help you to move
                    ahead and give you necessary details about the mountains.
                    There is a village located nearby from where it becomes
                    easy to go to Mount Nimba.

                    turtles differ in their species and they are unique in
                    their own style. The coastal scenery of the place is very
                    beautiful with many activities designed for the visitors

        <p class="about-countries">
          Guinea is a country in West Africa, bordered on the west by the
          Atlantic Ocean. It's known for the Mount Nimba Strict Nature
          Reserve, in the southeast. The reserve protects a forested mountain
          range rich in native plants and animals, including chimpanzees and
          the viviparous toad. On the coast, the capital city, Conakry, is
          home to the modern Grand Mosque and the National Museum, with its
          regional artifacts. A West African country, Guinea was formerly
          known as French Guinea and is sometimes called Guinea Conakry to
          separate it from its neighbor, Guinea Bissau. Conakry is the largest
          city, seat of government, and capital. Guinea’s area is 246,000 sq.
          km and the country forms a crescent with a curve from its western
          border to the Atlantic. Mali, Senegal, and Guinea-Bissau share the
          northern border and Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Côte d’Ivoire are to
          the south. The Niger River flows east and arises in Guinea. The
          10,000,000 people in Guinea are part of 24 ethnic groups. The main
          groups are the Fula, Mandinka, and Susu.

        <p class="culture-content">
          Guinea's culture is layered and interesting, inhabited by a wide
          range of ethnic groups, each with their own distinct traditions and
          many variations in language. Despite these differences, Guineans are
          predominantly Muslim, adhering to the teachings and religious
          observances of Islam.Among the major ethnic groups in the country
          are Peuhl or Fula (in the Fouta Djalon region), the Maninka (in the
          forests and savannahs of Upper Guinea), Susus (in Conakry), and
          smaller groups like Toma, Kissis, Kpelle, and Gerzé (in the forests
          and coastal areas). Music is one of the biggest aspects of Guinean
          culture, and locals celebrate a lot of festivals to commemorate this
          prevalent art form. Guineans play a wide range of string and
          percussion instruments, including the ngoni, balafon, kora (a hybrid
          of a lute and harp), and the guitar. Folk music is also accompanied
          by dunun, paired with the djembe (drums).

              The modern state of Guinea did not come into existence until
              1958, but the history of the area stretches back well before
              European colonization. Its current boundaries were determined
              during the colonial period by the Berlin Conference and the
              French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.For more than 100 years,
              Guinea was part of the former French Colonial Empire. It became
              a protectorate in 1849, a colony in 1898, and a constituent
              territory of French West Africa in 1904.But even after 1960,
              France still loomed large over the economy and cultural life of
