                                Kwame Nkrumah PC (21 September 1909– 27 April 1972) was a Ghanaian politician, political
                                theorist, and revolutionary. He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana,
                                having
                                led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of
                                Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and
                                winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political
                                philosophy,
                                and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast
                                to
                                begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed the
                                Convention
                                People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the
                                common
                                voter. He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained the position when Ghana declared
                                independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and
                                elected Nkrumah President.

                                His administration was primarily socialist as well as nationalist. It funded national
                                industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and
                                promoted a
                                pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African
                                international
                                relations during the decolonization period.

                                In 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as
                                president
                                for life of both the nation and its party.Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the National
                                Liberation Council, under whose supervision, international financial institutions
                                privatized
                                many of the country's state corporations.Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea,
                                where
                                he was named honorary co-president.

                                Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
                                anti-apartheid
                                revolutionary, statesman and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from
                                1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a
                                fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the
                                legacy
                                of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.
                                Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the
                                African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

                                A Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South
                                Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of
                                Witwatersrand
                                before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial
                                and
                                African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League
                                in
                                1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system
                                of
                                racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to
                                its
                                overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to
                                prominence
                                for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People.
                                He
                                was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in
                                the
                                1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African
                                Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
                                association
                                with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage
                                campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and
                                subsequently
                                sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the
                                Rivonia
                                Trial.

                                Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and
                                Victor
                                Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial
                                civil
                                war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to
                                negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election
                                in
                                which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition
                                government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation
                                between
                                the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to
                                investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its
                                predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing
                                measures
                                to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services.
                                Internationally,
                                Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as
                                secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second
                                presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder
                                statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson
                                Mandela Foundation.

                                Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right
                                denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed him too eager to
                                negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for
                                his
                                activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more
                                than
                                250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South
                                Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as
                                the
                                "Father of the Nation".

                                Haile Selassie I born Tafari Makonnen; 23 July 1892 – 27 August 1975) was Emperor of
                                Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. Prior to his coronation, he had been the Regent

                                as an emperor in the 1930s.He was a member of the Solomonic dynasty who traced his
                                lineage
                                to Emperor Menelik I, the son of King Solomon and Makeda the Queen of Sheba.

                                Haile Selassie attempted to modernize the country through a series of political and
                                social
                                reforms, including the introduction of Ethiopia's first written constitution and the
                                abolition of slavery. He led the failed efforts to defend Ethiopia during the Second
                                Italo-Ethiopian War and spent the period of Italian occupation in exile in England. He
                                returned to lead Ethiopia in 1941 after the British Empire defeated the Italian
                                occupiers in
                                the East African campaign. He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, which
                                was
                                established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, and integrated Eritrea as a province of
                                Ethiopia while fighting to prevent their secession.

                                His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United
                                Nations.In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity,
                                the
                                precursor of the African Union, and served as its first chairman. He was overthrown in a
                                1974 military coup by a Marxist–Leninist junta, the Derg. Selassie was murdered by the
                                junta
                                on 27 August 1975.

                                Among some members of the Rastafari movement, Haile Selassie is referred to as the
                                returned
                                messiah of the Bible, God incarnate. This distinction notwithstanding, Haile Selassie
                                was a
                                Christian and adhered to the tenets and liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox church.The
                                Rastafari movement was founded in Jamaica sometime around 1930 and its followers are
                                estimated at between 700,000 and one million as of 2012.

                                He has been criticized by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the
                                landed
                                aristocracy (the mesafint), which consistently opposed his reforms; some critics have
                                also
                                criticized Ethiopia's failure to modernize rapidly enough.During his rule the Harari
                                people
                                were persecuted and many left the Harari Region.His regime was also criticized by human
                                rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal.During the Haile
                                Selassie regime the Oromo language was legally banned from education, public speaking
                                and
                                use in administrationhowever there were never any laws promulgated by Haile Selassie's
                                government that made any language illegal.The Amhara culture dominated throughout the
                                eras
                                of military and monarchic rule. Both the Haile Selassie and the Derg government
                                relocated
                                numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia where they served in government administration,
                                courts, church and even in school, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by
                                Amharic.Once literacy rates increased in Ethiopia the Emperor included constitutional
                                recognition of every minority language in Article four of the 1974 Draft Constitution
                                which
                                the Derg outright rejected.Following the death of Hachalu Hundessa in June 2020, the
                                Statue
                                of Haile Selassie in Cannizaro Park, London was destroyed by Oromo protesters, and his
                                father's equestrian monument in Harar was removed.

                                Julius Kambarage Nyerere 13 April 1922 – 14 October 1999) was a Tanzanian anti-colonial
                                activist, politician, and political theorist. He governed Tanganyika as Prime Minister
                                from
                                1961 to 1962 and then as President from 1963 to 1964, after which he led its successor
                                state, Tanzania, as President from 1964 to 1985. He was a founding member and chair of
                                the
                                Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) party, and of its successor Chama Cha
                                Mapinduzi,
                                from 1954 to 1990. Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he
                                promoted a
                                political philosophy known as Ujamaa.

                                Born in Butiama, then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a
                                Zanaki
                                chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at Makerere College in Uganda and then
                                Edinburgh University in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked
                                as
                                a teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan
                                independence from the British Empire. Influenced by the Indian independence leader
                                Mahatma
                                Gandhi, Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the
                                Legislative
                                Council in the 1958–1959 elections, Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the 1960 general
                                election, becoming Prime Minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in
                                Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere
                                elected its first president. His administration pursued decolonisation and the
                                "Africanisation" of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans
                                and
                                the country's Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a one-party
                                state and unsuccessfully pursued the Pan-Africanist formation of an East African
                                Federation
                                with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British
                                assistance.

                                Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964, the island of Zanzibar was unified with
                                Tanganyika to form Tanzania. After this, Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national
                                self-reliance and socialism. Although his socialism differed from that promoted by
                                Marxism–Leninism, Tanzania developed close links with Mao Zedong's Marxist-governed
                                China.
                                In 1967, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration which outlined his vision of ujamaa.
                                Banks
                                and other major industries and companies were nationalised; education and healthcare
                                were
                                significantly expanded. Renewed emphasis was placed on agricultural development through
                                the
                                formation of communal farms, although these reforms hampered food production and left
                                areas
                                dependent on food aid. His government provided training and aid to anti-colonialist
                                groups
                                fighting white-minority rule throughout southern Africa and oversaw Tanzania's 1978–1979
                                war
                                with Uganda which resulted in the overthrow of Ugandan President Idi Amin. In 1985,
                                Nyerere
                                stood down and was succeeded by Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who reversed many of Nyerere's
                                policies.
                                He remained chair of Chama Cha Mapinduzi until 1990, supporting a transition to a
                                multi-party system, and later served as mediator in attempts to end the Burundian Civil
                                War.

                                Nyerere was a controversial figure. Across Africa he gained widespread respect as an
                                anti-colonialist and in power received praise for ensuring that, unlike many of its
                                neighbours, Tanzania remained stable and unified in the decades following independence.
                                His
                                construction of the one-party state and use of detention without trial led to
                                accusations of
                                dictatorial governance, while he has also been blamed for economic mismanagement. He is
                                held
                                in deep respect within Tanzania, where he is often referred to by the Swahili honorific
                                Mwalimu ("teacher") and described as the "Father of the Nation".

                                Patrice Émery Lumumba 2 July 1925 – 17 January 1961) was a Congolese politician and
                                independence leader who served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic
                                Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo) from June until September 1960. He
                                played
                                a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an
                                independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he led
                                the
                                Congolese National Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination.

                                Shortly after Congolese independence in 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking
                                the
                                beginning of the Congo Crisis. Lumumba appealed to the United States and the United

                                for help to suppress the Belgian-supported Katangan secessionists led by Moïse Tshombe.

                                refused due to suspicions among the Western world that Lumumba ambiguously held
                                pro-communist views. These suspicions appeared to be supported when Lumumba turned to
                                the
                                Soviet Union for assistance, which the CIA described as a "classic communist
                                takeover".This
                                led to growing differences with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and chief-of-staff
                                Joseph-Désiré
                                Mobutu, as well as with the United States and Belgium, who opposed the Soviet Union in
                                the
                                Cold War.

                                After Mobutu's military coup, Lumumba attempted to escape to Stanleyville to join his
                                supporters who had established a new anti-Mobutu rival state called the Free Republic of
                                the
                                Congo. However, Lumumba was subsequently captured and imprisoned en route by state
                                authorities under Mobutu and executed by a firing squad under the command of Katangan
                                authorities. Following his assassination, he was widely seen as a martyr for the wider
                                Pan-African movement. In 2002, Belgium formally apologised for its role in the
                                assassination.

                                Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara 21 December 1949 – 15 October 1987) was a Burkinabé military
                                officer and socialist revolutionary who served as the President of Burkina Faso from his
                                coup in 1983 to his deposition and killing in 1987. A Marxist–Leninist and
                                pan-Africanist,
                                he was viewed by supporters as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution and is
                                sometimes referred to as "Africa's Che Guevara".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After being appointed Prime Minister in 1983, disputes with the sitting government led
                                to
                                Sankara's eventual imprisonment. While he was under house arrest, a group of
                                revolutionaries
                                seized power on his behalf in a popularly-supported coup later that year.

                                Aged 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta. He immediately
                                launched programmes for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country
                                from
                                the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso ("Land of Incorruptible People"),
                                with
                                its people being called Burkinabé ("upright people"). His foreign policies were centred
                                on
                                anti-imperialism, while he rejected aid from organizations such as the International
                                Monetary Fund. Sankara welcomed foreign aid from other sources but tried to reduce
                                reliance
                                on aid by boosting domestic revenues and diversifying the sources of assistance.

                                His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency
                                and
                                land reform, prioritising education with a nationwide literacy campaign and promoting
                                public
                                health by vaccinating more than 2 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and
                                measles. Between 18,000 and 50,000 children who died annually of measles and meningitis
                                lived.Burkinabe built for the first time scores of schools, health centers, water
                                reservoirs, and nearly 100 km of rail, with little or no external assistance. Total
                                cereal
                                production rose by 75% between 1983 and 1986.

                                Other components of his national agenda included planting over 10 million trees to
                                combat
                                the growing desertification of the Sahel, redistributing land from private landowners,
                                suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents and establishing a road and railway
                                construction programme.On the local level, Sankara called on every village to build a
                                medical dispensary and had pharmacies built in 5,384 out of 7,500 villages.[16] From
                                1982 to
                                1984 the infant mortality rate dropped from 208 per 1,000 births to 145. School

                                under Sankara increased from 6% to 22%.

                                Moreover, he outlawed female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy. He
                                appointed
                                women to high governmental positions and encouraged them to work outside the home and
                                stay
                                in school, even if pregnant.Sankara encouraged the prosecution of officials accused of
                                corruption, counter-revolutionaries and "lazy workers" in Popular Revolutionary
                                Tribunals.As
                                an admirer of the Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the
                                Defense of
                                the Revolution.Such programs led to criticism by Amnesty International and other
                                non-governmental organizations for violations of human rights, who alleged that there
                                were
                                extrajudicial executions and arbitrary detentions of political opponents.

                                His revolutionary programmes for African self-reliance made him an icon to many of
                                Africa's
                                poor. Sankara remained popular with most of his country's citizens.However, his policies
                                alienated and antagonised several groups, which included the small but powerful
                                Burkinabé
                                middle class, the tribal leaders who were stripped of their long-held traditional
                                privileges
                                of forced labour and tribute payments, and the governments of France and its ally the
                                Ivory
                                Coast.Opposition parties and unions were banned and media freedoms curtailed. Striking
                                teachers were fired and replaced by young people with no experience.On 15 October 1987,
                                Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaoré, who assumed leadership of the
                                state shortly after having Sankara killed.

                                Jomo Kenyatta(c. 1897 – 22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and
                                politician
                                who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first
                                President
                                from 1964 to his death in 1978. He was the country's first indigenous head of government
                                and
                                played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British
                                Empire
                                into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and conservative, he
                                led
                                the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.

                                Kenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a
                                mission
                                school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu
                                Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs.
                                During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the
                                East,
                                University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an
                                anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during
                                the
                                Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist
                                and
                                Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He
                                returned to
                                Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the
                                Kenya
                                African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule,
                                attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he
                                was
                                among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau
                                Mau
                                Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was
                                convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar
                                until 1961.

                                On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the
                                1963
                                general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into
                                an
                                independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state,
                                he
                                transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and
                                prohibited KANU's only rival—Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union—from competing
                                in
                                elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and
                                its
                                European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and
                                Kenya's
                                army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta

                                His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the "Africanisation" of the
                                economy,
                                prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were
                                expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated
                                ethnic
                                tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the
                                Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid
                                the
                                Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi.

                                Kenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white
                                settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained
                                widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the
                                honorary
                                title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the
                                black
                                majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule
                                was
                                criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neo-colonial, of favouring Kikuyu over
                                other
                                ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption.

                                Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (born Ellen Eugenia Johnson, 29 October 1938) is a Liberian
                                politician
                                who served as the 24th President of Liberia from 2006 to 2018. Sirleaf was the first
                                elected
                                female head of state in Africa.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sirleaf was born in Monrovia to a Gola father and Kru-German mother. She was educated at
                                the
                                College of West Africa. She completed her education in the United States, where she
                                studied
                                at Madison Business College and Harvard University. She returned to Liberia to work in
                                William Tolbert's government as Deputy Minister of Finance from 1971 to 1974. Later she
                                worked again in the West, for the World Bank in the Caribbean and Latin America. In
                                1979,
                                she received a cabinet appointment as Minister of Finance, serving to 1980.

                            <p>
                                After Samuel Doe seized power that year in a coup d'état and executed Tolbert, Sirleaf
                                fled
                                to the United States. She worked for Citibank and then the Equator Bank. She returned to
                                Liberia to contest a senatorial seat for Montserrado County in 1985, an election that
                                was
                                disputed. She was arrested as a result of her open criticism of the military government
                                in
                                1985 and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, although was later released.

                                Sirleaf continued to be involved in politics. She finished in second place at the 1997
                                presidential election, which was won by Charles Taylor.

                                She won the 2005 presidential election and took office on 16 January 2006. She was
                                re-elected in 2011. She was the first woman in Africa elected as president of her
                                country.
                                She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, in recognition of her efforts to bring women into
                                the
                                peacekeeping process. She has received numerous other awards for her leadership.

                                In June 2016, Sirleaf was elected as the Chair of the Economic Community of West African
                                States, making her the first woman to hold the position since it was created.
