                      Hectic, frenetic, smooth and sophisticated (at least in its own, very West African way), Monrovia is home to more than one million Liberians.
                      The largest city in the country, it is a place of great energy.
                      Rumbling bush taxis float over the pot-holed roads around the center, while the bustling boulevard of Broad Street, nestled between the meanders of the Mesurado River and the Atlantic Ocean, is a picture of life.

                      Unquestionably the most famous of Liberia’s duo of national parks comes in the form of the Sapo National Park.
                      This 1,804 square kilometer territory of the Upper Guinean Rainforest is said to have one of the highest mammal biodiversity counts of anywhere in the world.
                      And boy does it show! Intrepid folk who opt to delve into the old growth woods will get to spy out pygmy hippopotami and white-crested Diana monkeys, crocodiles, leopards, speckle-throated otters and chimpanzees.

                      The Gola National Forest is the new name for the Lofa-Mano National Park: a great dash of primeval rainforest that sprawls out along the northern border of the country with Sierra Leone.
                      One of the densest remaining tracts of Upper Guinean woodland in the region, the area has everything you’d expect of a real West African wilderness.
                      Yep, you can expect verdant canopies and seemingly endless stretches of colossal tree trunks and boughs, hidden fern fields where exotic dragonflies flit between the flowers, swinging chimpanzees, rare pygmy hippopotamus – the list goes on!

                    <p>
                      The island of Bushrod gets its name from one of the few American politicians that actually advocated the resettlement of slaves on the continent back in the 1800s.
                      But that’s about as deep as the erstwhile politician, Bushrod Washington’s, influence runs in this mangrove-fringed port town on the edge of the Atlantic.
                      Today, streets of tooting vehicles run in and out of the jetties and docks, the ramshackle slums of New Kru Town sprawl close to the shoreline, and there’s an indelible energy of life throughout.
                      It’s not the most comfortable place to visit, granted, but it is an interesting glimpse at working, modern Liberia nonetheless.

                      Tourists will really only make a beeline for the ocean-side reaches of laid-back Marshall for two reasons.
                      The first is its smattering of empty beaches, each backed by verdant pockets of palm forest and mangrove swamps, and perfect for enjoying some truly intrepid camping on the Liberian coast.
                      The second is the small archipelago appropriately named Monkey Island.
                      Here, a troupe of feisty chimps inhabit the jungles.

                      One of the favoured gateways to the aforementioned Sapo National Park (which can be found lurking between the dense forests just a little to the east of town), Greenville is no stranger to tourists.
                      However, while most who arrive simply stock up and head out to see the chimps and exotic rainforests of the reserve, those who linger will get to see an intriguing remnant of Liberia’s resettlement era – the town does still bear the moniker of its namesake in Mississippi after all! There are also some interesting villages to explore up the courses of the Sinoe River, along with some truly unspoilt beaches along the coast to the west.

                      Situated in the extreme south of Liberia, where the turns of the African panhandle give way to the beaches of the Ivory Coast, the city of Harper has its fair share of both natural and human attractions.
                      For starters, the shores to the north-west and south of town are fringed with gorgeous Robinson Crusoe sands, with swaying coconut palms bristling against the Atlantic breezes at their back.
                      And then there are the remnants of Liberia’s old slave settlers, who are thought to have first begun crafting the modern state on the lands of Cape Palmas where Harper now stands.

                      The king of all Liberia’s surfing spots (and there are quite a few), Robertsport has positioned itself firmly on the forefront of the country’s new tourism drive.
                      Long-haired wave riders with board wax in hand now flock to join the surfing troupes and hit the rolling Atlantic swells that buffet the likes of Fisherman’s Point, Cotton Trees and Cassava.
                      Surf schools are also popping up to get beginner travelers out and onto the waves, while  others will just come to hike the coastal stretches to see the pretty reaches of Cape Mount Bay, and see the trademark timber and stone churches that pepper the shore.

          <p class="about-countries">
            Liberia is a country in West Africa, bordering Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. On the Atlantic coast, the capital city of Monrovia is home to the Liberia National Museum, with its exhibits on national culture and history. Around Monrovia are palm-lined beaches like Silver and CeCe. Along the coast, beach towns include the port of Buchanan, as well as laid-back Robertsport, known for its strong surf.
            Liberia is unique amongst African states in that it was founded by freed slaves from the American South, bringing with them their own culture and displacing ancient tribes who’d farmed the land and traded with European enclaves in west Africa for centuries. For the first time since its founding, the diverse ethnicities of the region are joining together in the aftermath of the devastating 14-year civil war to create a new, peaceful and successful, chapter in both history and culture.

            The six larger groups are the Akan (Ashanti and Fanti), the Ewe, the Ga-Adangbe, the Mole-Dagbani, the Guan and the Gruma.
            Like most other African nations, Ghana has rich, traditional cultures that differ from one ethnic group to another.<br>
            Along with different ethnic groups and cultures, 52 separate languages and hundreds of dialects are spoken in Ghana.
              The official language is English — a residual of British colonial rule, from which modern Ghana gained independence in 1957.
            The people of Ghana are warm and friendly. They are polite, open and trusting — even with strangers.
              In Ghanaian society, it is traditional to take life at a relaxed pace and view time as a series of events rather than a matter of hours or minutes.

            Kente (Akan: nwentoma; Ewe: kete) refers to a Ghanaian textile, made of handwoven cloth, strips of silk and cotton.
             Historically the fabric was worn in a toga-like fashion by royalty among ethnic groups such as the Ashanti and Ewe in modern day Ghana,
             the wearing of Kente cloth has become widespread to commemorate special occasions, with highly sought after Kente brands led by master weavers.<br>
            Due to the popularity of Kente cloth patterns, Kente print, which is a mass-produced version,
             is popular throughout the West. Globally, the print is used in the design of academic stoles in graduation ceremonies.
