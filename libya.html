                    In 500 BC, it was set up by the Phoenicians. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, it was revamped
                    and taken control by Rome. As of present, what remains is only a 3-story theatre and few other
                    sanctuaries of the end of the 3rd century. These sanctuaries are committed to Serapis, Isis, and
                    Liber Pater. This old port city has few antiquities to behold in an adjacent gallery.

                  <p>
                    Cyrene is one of the best places in Libya and the most seasoned Greek urban community. The country's
                    traditional name, "Cyrenaica" was taken from it. In 630 BC, this place was a settlement for the
                    Greeks. However, in 96 BC, it turned into a Roman city. Cyrene answers the question of where are the
                    top tourist places in Libya. If you are a lover of archaeology, don't miss coming here for anything.
                    You will see different stunning structures and sanctuaries for Zeus, Apollo, and Demeter.

                    Phoenicians and later turned into a Punic city. By 23 BC, it fit in with a Roman region in Africa. A
                    standout amongst the most conspicuous structures left in the destroyed city is the theatre. You can

                    Benghazi was once the capital of Libya together with Tripoli. This led to real head-ways towards the
                    progress and growth of the city. As of present, the city is the capital of the Cyrenaica area. When

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">About Libya</h2>
        <p class="about-countries">
          Libya, country located in North Africa. Most of the country lies in the Sahara desert, and much of its
          population is concentrated along the coast and its immediate hinterland, where Tripoli (Ṭarābulus), the de
          facto capital, and Banghāzī (Benghazi), another major city, are located.
          Libya comprises three historical regions—Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan in
          the southwest. The Ottoman authorities recognized them as separate provinces. Under Italian rule, they were
          unified to form a single colony, which gave way to independent Libya. For much of Libya’s early history, both
          Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were more closely linked with neighbouring territories than with one other.

          about three decades, which had a great impact on the culture. Libya has managed to keep its traditional folk
          culture alive to today. The majority of Libyans are Arab, and 96.6% are Muslim Sunnis.

              From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as Italian North Africa. From 1927 to 1934, the
              territory was split into two colonies, Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania, run by Italian
              governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.
