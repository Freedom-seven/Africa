        <p class="about-countries">
          Mali, landlocked country of western Africa, mostly in the Saharan and Sahelian regions. Mali is largely flat
          and arid. The Niger River flows through its interior, functioning as the main trading and transport artery in
          the country. Sections of the river flood periodically, providing much-needed fertile agricultural soil along
          its banks as well as creating pasture for livestock.
          Mali, officially the Republic of Mali, is a landlocked country in West Africa. Mali is the eighth-largest
          country in Africa, with an area of just over 1,240,000 square kilometres. The population of Mali is 19.1
          million. 67% of its population was estimated to be under the age of 25 in 2017.

              Mali’s recorded history began with the Ghana Empire, which extended across the borders of present-day Mali
              and Mauritania during the 4th and 11th centuries. The Ghana Empire’s golden age began after camels were
              domesticated and able to transport salt, gold and ivory as far as the Middle East, North Africa and even
              Europe. Bamako’s National Museum of Mali (Kati) provides the most detailed displays of the country’s rich
              history.

            </p>
            <p>
              It is unclear exactly when the Ghana Empire became part of the much larger Mali Empire, but by the early
              14th century, Mali was one of Africa’s largest gold suppliers and most powerful states. Timbuktu became
              the leading center of Islamic education, with no fewer than 180 religious schools, three universities and
              countless private libraries. The largest library on Earth was once housed inside the Djinguereber Mosque
              (Askia Mohamed Boulevard, Timbuktu), one of Timbuktu’s few surviving landmarks from the golden era.
            </p>
            <p>
              Timbuktu’s prominence and prosperity increased even further after Emperor Mansa Musa I brought a slew of
              gold and slaves to Mecca in 1324, but the Songhai Empire from present-day Nigeria eventually displaced
              them by the late 15th century. The Moroccan army, who defeated the Songhai by 1590, could not hold the
              area for very long, and Mali eventually split into several smaller states.
