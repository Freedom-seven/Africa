        <h2 style="text-align: center;">About Senegal</h2>
        <p class="about-countries">
          Senegal, country in western Africa. Located at the westernmost point of the continent and served by multiple
          air and maritime travel routes, Senegal is known as the “Gateway to Africa.” The country lies at an ecological
          boundary where semiarid grassland, oceanfront, and tropical rainforest converge; this diverse environment has
          endowed Senegal with a wide variety of plant and animal life. It is from this rich natural heritage that the
          country’s national symbols were chosen: the baobab tree and the lion.The region today known as Senegal was
          long a part of the ancient Ghana and Djolof kingdoms and an important node on trans-Saharan caravan routes. It
          was also an early point of European contact and was contested by England, France, Portugal, and the
          Netherlands before ultimately coming under French control in the late 19th century. It remained a colony of
          France until 1960, when, under the leadership of the writer and statesman Léopold Senghor, it gained its
          independence—first as part of the short-lived Mali Federation and then as a wholly sovereign state.

              Senegal has been inhabited for thousands of years. ... In 1959 Senegal and the French Soudan merged and
