                      Deep in the recesses of Tagrin Bay, just a short ferry ride from the jetties of the capital at Freetown, the rock that is Bunce Island offers a glimpse into the darker days of West African history.
                      Just one of 40 individual citadels that were raised by the Europeans along the shoreline of the region during the heyday of the slave trade, the spot is known to have been one of the primary points where British vessels laden with captured people departed for the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia across the Atlantic.

                      Languishing off the coast of the Western Area, south from the capital at Freetown, the finger of land that forms Banana Island has all the shimmering, alabaster-hued beaches and lush rainforest you’d expect of a place so deep in the tropics.
                      In fact, that cocktail of beautiful natural draws has made this one arguably the most popular weekend getaway from the big city, and there are now some good guesthouses in hotels in the fishing settlements of Dublin and Ricketts as a result.

                      Engulfed by the weaving, winding capillaries of the Moa River as the main channel splits in two in the heart of Sierra Leon’s Southern Province, Tiwai Island remains one of the most famous conservation spots in the country.
                      A rare draw away from the coast, the riparian land is home to some of the last remaining virgin rainforest in Sierra Leone.
                      And the wildlife is equally as totemic, with Diana monkeys and pygmy hippos, tool-using chimpanzees (a truly awesome feat) and curious pangolins all making the reserve their home.

                      Bamboo parasols rustle in the Atlantic breezes; sands shimmer in gleaming yellow-golden hues; the salty whitecaps of the ocean buffet the palm-peppered shore: Welcome to Tokeh Beach – arguably the single most accomplished seaside resort in the entire of Sierra Leone.
                      Thanks to its gorgeous coastal stretches, this little town east of Freetown and in the heart of the Western Area Rural District has grown up with countless luxury hotels and guesthouses.

                      If you’re eager to keep company with chimpanzees and swinging mangabeys, then there can really be no substitute for the vast reaches of the Outamba Kilimi National Park.
                      They sit in the extreme north of Sierra Leone, unfolding close to the border with the Republic of Guinea in a mosaic of savannah and woodland, groves of goomar teaks and hills that poke just above the canopies.

                      At the very heart of one of Sierra Leone’s fertile breadbasket regions, and set high amidst the breezy tops of the north-eastern hills, the town of Kabala is a welcome break from the sun-scorched, dust-caked places of the country’s lowlands.
                      It’s also a pretty spot, peppered with low-rise bungalows and tin-roofed builds, imbued with lively local farmers’ markets and surrounded by bucolic swathes.

                      A large shard of land that fragments from Sierra Leone and points straight out into the Atlantic Ocean, Sherbro Island is cut-through by countless river channels and formed from sweeping vistas of wetland and swamp.
                      It’s a sleepy and rustic place, with just a smattering of small towns like Bonthe and pint-sized San, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Sherbro people – contented, bucolic and curiously westernized fishing types.

          <p class="about-countries">
            Sierra Leone is a country in West Africa, on the Atlantic Ocean. It’s known for the white-sand beaches lining the Freetown Peninsula. The capital city, Freetown, commemorates the nation’s slave-trade history with the Cotton Tree landmark and King’s Yard Gate. Both were known as places of refuge for returned slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nearby Bunce Island was a key departure point during the slave trade.Sierra Leone, as with most African countries, has a complicated history, characterized by colonization and civil war. That said, since the end of the civil war, the people and the government have done a tremendous job of moving forward and rebuilding the country. The culture is clearly an eclectic mix of both regional and international influences.
            The people of Sierra Leone are well known for their friendliness and hospitality, with a relaxed pace on life. The locals are expressive and joyful, and religious beliefs and customs are very much present in everyday life. Greetings are very important in Sierra Leonean culture, and elders are especially respected.

            Despite Sierra Leone’s colonial history, the tumultuous road to independence, and tragic civil war, the country has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous cultures, while, at the same time, incorporating many of the influences brought from overseas. Such an amalgamation makes for an interesting experience for travelers who are interested in immersing themselves as much as possible into the local culture. The different local and international influences are clearly evidenced by the country’s cuisine, sports, and music.

                Life in Sierra Leone can be traced back to 2,500 years ago, when different ethnic and cultural groups migrated to the region from other parts of the continent. This migration is evidence by many important historical finds, such as ancient pottery and weaponry. The groups that inhabited the region included the Bulom, Sherbo, Loko, Susu, Fula and Limba peoples.
                The 15th century brought with it the country’s first contact with Europeans, as Portuguese ships descended on the region. With the arrival of the 17th century, however, Portuguese domination began to diminish, making way for British Imperialism. This period of British rule marked the height of the international slave trade, during which thousands of Africans were taken from their countries and shipped to locations in North America and the West Indies, forced into a life of hard labor and poverty. To learn more about Sierra Leone’s role during the slave trade, visit the trade port on Bunce Island and the accompanying museum in Freetown.
